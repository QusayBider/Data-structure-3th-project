# Data-structure-3th-project
In this project, you will implement an application of AVL and Hash table. The application will efficiently index words found in a text file. The application will use an AVL tree to maintain a balanced order of words for fast retrieval and sorting. Additionally, the words will be stored in a hash table for fast access.
